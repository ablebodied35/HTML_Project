			<h3>Top Streaming Artists</h3>
		<p>Assignment 1 involved linked lists. Linked lists are a data structure developed in 1955 by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw and Herbert A. Simon at RAND Corporation. Linked lists have many strengths. Insertion is relatively quick and easy, the case is the same for deleting. It is conservative when it comes to memory and keeps memory wastage at a low. However, there are disadvantages. Since the nodes are connected to each other, if the list is damaged you risk losing all your data. It can also be slow to search through the list. In this assignment, we were tasked to assort song names and titles first into a 2-D array, and then into a linked list. The catch was that we needed to sort the names alphabetically then count how many songs each artist had on the list with no repeat songs taken into account. Data was taken from the spotify charts.

			<h3>Music Playlist</h3>
			<p>This assignment had students use queues and stacks. Queues and stacks are data structures which are quite similar to each other. Queues are a FIFO data structure. FIFO stands for first-in-first-out. Essentially, in a queue you insert data in and that piece of data is the first to be processed. Stacks are a LIFO. LIFO stands for Last-In-First-Out. The last data piece you insert into a stack is the first one to be processed. In this assignment, students had to process multiple weeks of spotify charts and sort them into separate playlists. These playlists could be in the form of a queue. The data would then be, for the sake of our assignment, stacked into a stack after the imaginary VIP would be done listening to a song.

			<h3>Movie Titles</h3>
			<p>This assignment concerned itself with binary trees. Binary trees are a data structure that can be used for mass storage. The main benefit a binary tree can offer is an insanely quick search through. A binary tree has nodes which then have two child nodes, a left and right node. The left node is smaller than the right node. This is important because the data is stored based on these qualities. The heavier data is stored into the right nodes while the left nodes hold the lighter ones. In this assignment, movie title and their release year were stored into a binary tree. The amount of data was enormous but the searching through the tree made it extremely fast. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/shehryarali53/MovieTitles" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Movie Genres</h3>
			<p>This assignment used hashmaps. HashMap is a Map based collection class that is used for storing Key & value pairs. In this assignment, students had to parse movie genres, movie titles, and their release years. This data was then iterated through in order to count how many movies belonged to a specific genre. After this, the hashmap was iterated through again but this time taking the release year and genres into account. Students had to figure out how many movies of a specific genre came out in each year.
